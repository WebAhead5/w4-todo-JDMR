# Todo App

## Introduction

Our task was to build a todo list app, using vanilla javascript and implementing Test Driven Development (TDD).

The app implemented functionality as directed in the user story below:

### User stories:

As a disorganised person I want to:

 * enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
 * view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
 * mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
 * the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

#### Potential stretch goals

As a disorganised person I want to:

 * edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
 * click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
 * a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing

## Outcome

We implemented all goals and stretch goals except for the requirement to enable the user to click on any part of the todo in order to mark it as complete. We decided instead to offer functionality to drag and drop to allow the user to re-order their list.

We also added:
* Undo functionality (ctrl+z also works)
* Remove all checked items
* Automatic re-sorting

Here we can see how to add todo items:
